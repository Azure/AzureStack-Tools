# Validate Azure ARM Template Capabilities
Instructions below are relative to the .\TemplateValidator folder of the [AzureStack-Tools repo](..).
To Validate Compute Capabilities such as Images, Extensions & Sizes available in the CloudCapabilities.json add -IncludeComputeCapabilities
To Validate Storage Capabilities such as Skus available in the CloudCapabilities.json add -IncludeStorageCapabilities
```powershell
Import-Module ".\AzureRM.TemplateValidator.psm1"
```
# Prerequisites
Create CloudCapabilities.json by using Get-AzureRMCloudCapabilities tool [AzureStack-Tools repo/CloudCapabilities](../CloudCapabilities). or use the provided sample AzureStackCapabilities_TP2.json in this folder
For Azure/AzureStack quickstart templates, git clone from below links
https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-QuickStart-Templates/
https://github.com/Azure/Azure-QuickStart-Templates/
# Usage
```powershell
$TemplatePath = "<Provide Template(s) Path>"
$CapabilitiesPath = ".\AzureStackCapabilities_TP3.json"
Test-AzureRMTemplate -TemplatePath $TemplatePath -CapabilitiesPath $CapabilitiesPath -Verbose #-IncludeComputeCapabilities -IncludeStorageCapabilities
```
#Reporting Usage
Passed - Validation passed. The template has all the Capabilities to deploy on the validated Cloud 
NotSupported - The template Capabilities is currently not supported on the validated cloud
Exception - Exception in processing and validating the template
Recommend - The template has all the Capabilities to deploy on the validated Cloud but has recommendations for best practices
Warning - Changes are required either in Template or the validated cloud to deploy succesfully

# TroubleShooting
For "NotSupported" - Refer the region specific capability JSON for the supported capabilities.
For Warnings(in Console Output) such as "No StorageSkus found in region specific Capabilities JSON file.", Please run Get-AzureRMCloudCapabilities with -IncludeComputeCapabilities and -IncludeStorageCapabilities
