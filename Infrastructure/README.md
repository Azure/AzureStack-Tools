# Azure Stack Infrastructure Administration

Instructions below are relative to the .\Infrastructure folder of the [AzureStack-Tools repo](..).
This also requires the Azure Stack Connect Module to be imported before running any of the commands. The Module can also be found in the [AzureStack-Tools repo](..).

Whats new for TP3:

- New Cmdlet Name Prefix
- API Resource Name changes
- New cmdlets
- Use of Azure Stack Connect Module

## Import the Module

```powershell
Import-Module .\AzureStack.Infra.psm1
```

## Add PowerShell environment
```powershell
Import-Module .\AzureStack.Connect.psm1
```

You will need to reference your Azure Stack Administrator environment. To create an administrator environment use the below. The ARM endpoint below is the administrator default for a one-node environment.

```powershell
Add-AzureStackAzureRmEnvironment -Name "AzureStackAdmin" -ArmEndpoint "https://adminmanagement.local.azurestack.external"
```

Connecting to your environment requires that you obtain the value of your Directory Tenant ID. For **Azure Active Directory** environments provide your directory tenant name:

```powershell
$TenantID = Get-DirectoryTenantID -AADTenantName "<mydirectorytenant>.onmicrosoft.com" -EnvironmentName AzureStackAdmin
```

For **ADFS** environments use the following:

```powershell
$TenantID = Get-DirectoryTenantID -ADFS -EnvironmentName AzureStackAdmin
```

Then login:

```powershell
Login-AzureRmAccount -EnvironmentName "AzureStackAdmin" -TenantId $TenantID
```
