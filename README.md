# Tools for using Azure and Azure Stack

To use these tools, obtain Azure Stack compatible Azure PowerShell module and CLI. Unless you've installed from other sources, one way to do it is to obtain from public package repositories as follows. Note that both of these could still be used to operate against Azure as well as Azure Stack, but may lack some of the latest Azure features.

```powershell
Install-Module -Name AzureRm -RequiredVersion 1.2.6 -Scope CurrentUser
```

```
npm install azure-cli@0.9.18
```

Obtain the tools by cloning the git repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-Tools.git --recursive
cd AzureStack-Tools
```

Otherwise download the tools as follows

```powershell
invoke-webrequest https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-Tools/archive/master.zip -OutFile master.zip
expand-archive master.zip -DestinationPath . -Force
cd AzureStack-Tools-master
```
