# Azure Stack Development Kit Version

These tools are meant for use with **Azure Stack Development Kit**. Azure Stack Technical Preview 3 Refresh users can still use the tools in the [TP3-Refresh](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-Tools/tree/TP3-Refresh).

## Tools for using Azure and Azure Stack

To use these tools, obtain Azure Stack compatible Azure PowerShell module. Unless you've installed from other sources, one way to do it is to obtain from public package repositories as follows. Note that both of these could still be used to operate against Azure as well as Azure Stack, but may lack some of the latest Azure features.

For PowerShell, install the following:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name 'AzureRm.Bootstrapper'
Install-AzureRmProfile -profile '2017-03-09-profile' -Force
Install-Module -Name AzureStack -RequiredVersion 1.2.10
```

Obtain the tools by cloning the git repository.

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-Tools.git --recursive
cd AzureStack-Tools
```

Otherwise download the tools as follows:

```powershell
invoke-webrequest https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-Tools/archive/master.zip -OutFile master.zip
expand-archive master.zip -DestinationPath . -Force
cd AzureStack-Tools-master
```
